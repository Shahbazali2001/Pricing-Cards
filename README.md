Pricing cards Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript
Pricing Cards
Introduction
In this code example, we have a webpage that displays pricing cards for different subscription plans. The pricing cards are designed using HTML and CSS, and they provide information about the features and prices of each plan. The webpage is responsive and uses Bootstrap for styling.

Key Concepts
HTML: Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of the webpage.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It is used to style the pricing cards and make them visually appealing.
Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides pre-designed components and styles for building responsive web pages. It is used in this code example to style the pricing cards and make them responsive.
Code Structure
The code is structured as follows:

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies the HTML version and document type.
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
The <head> element contains meta information about the document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and external stylesheets.
The <body> element contains the content of the webpage.
Inside the <body> element, we have a heading <h1> that displays the title of the pricing cards.
The pricing cards are contained within a <div> element with the class container. This class provides a responsive container for the content.
Each pricing card is represented by a <div> element with the class card. It contains the card title, description, price, and a list of features.
The features are displayed as a list using the <ul> and <li> elements.
Each feature is represented by an <li> element with the class list-group-item. It contains an icon and the feature text.
At the bottom of the webpage, there is a footer <p> element that displays a text and an icon.
